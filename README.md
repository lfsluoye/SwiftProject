# SwiftProject
I am Li Fushuai ,a iOS Development Engineer and currently learning Swift.
This project was totally inspired by [Allen朝辉](http://www.jianshu.com/p/52032bc4cbe4)'s [30DaysofSwift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift) project, after read his article I made a decision to put my every single day to write Swift, this's the final code of 30 tiny Swift projects learn from him.Code is Similar but not the same except for GIF and forgive me, don't bother to do it.
